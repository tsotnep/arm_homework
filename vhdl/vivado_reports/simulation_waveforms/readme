i did the simulation and i took screenshots of waveforms.
so, on the waveforms, that I provided in this folder:
RED color waves(OutD & OutC) are output of entity "arm_vhdl" - that fulfills requested task
WHITE color waves(A & D) are INPUTS A and D of the entity. (also, reset_n & Go are inputs as well)
YELLOW color waves(receivedA & receivedD) are data-vectors, that were reconstructed from OutD & OutC, in testbench entity, they should be equal to white inputs: receivedA = A; receivedD = D;

rest of the signals are green.

please note, that on screenshot, i also included TCL console, so that you can make sure, there are no assert statements printed, that validates the correctness of the main entity.
