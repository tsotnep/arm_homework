after i saw the task that was given to me, i considered showing you the project i did for fun, previous year.
this project is called a "creeping line"

- video:

- however i also wrote an draft of manual, have not finished it because of studyings, 
but u can still take a look at it.
- sources are also provided in folder: src
- constraints of design is synthesized on FPGA board: digilent nexys 3

- short description:
three FPGAs are connected together (but number of FPGAs can be N)
and pre-stored text is displayed on seven segment displays, text is moving from left to right, 
like all seven segments were on one board. this is achieved by serial communication 
(here i'm using only one wire, however, not sending clock is dangerous and might cause data distortions, but this project if for fun, so i did not care much)

in current example, i'm writing following text:
"Hi dude", on video it's displaying like: "edud iH" because i wanted it like that. but changing order is matter of text array modification - rearrangement.

almost everything is parameterizable
